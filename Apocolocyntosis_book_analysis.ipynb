cries of joy and solemn litanyat once he bubbled up the ghost and there was an end to that shadow of alife he was listening to a troupe of comedians when he died so you see ihave reason to fear those gentry the last words he was heard to speak inthis world were these when he had made a great noise with that end of himwhich talked easiest he cried out oh dear oh dear i think i have madea mess of myself whether he did or no i cannot say but certain it ishe always did make a mess of everythingwhat happened next on earth it is mere waste of time to tell for you know it all well enough and there

informant word comes to jupiter that astranger had arrived a man well set up pretty grey he seemed to bethreatening something for he wagged his head ceaselessly he dragged theright foot they asked him what nation he was of he answered something ina confused mumbling voice his language they did not understand he was nogreek and no roman nor of any known race on this jupiter bids hercules goand find out what country he comes from you see hercules had travelledover the whole world and might be expected to know all the nations in itbut hercules the first glimpse he got was really much taken abackalthough not all the monsters in the world could frighten him when he sawthis new kind of object with its extraordinary gait and the voice of noterrestrial beast but such as you might hear in the leviathans of thedeep hoarse and inarticulate he thought his thirteenth labour had comeupon him when he looked closer the thing seemed to be a kind of manup he goes then and says what your greek finds readiest to his tongue who art thou and what thy people who thy parents where thy home sidenote od i claudius was delighted to find literary men up there and began to hopethere might be some corner for his own historical works so he caps himwith another homeric verse explaining that he was caesar breezes wafted me from ilion unto the ciconian land sidenote od ix but the next verse was more true and no less homeric thither come i sacked a city slew the people every onehe would have taken in poor simple hercules but that our lady of malaria was there who left her temple and came alone withhim all the other gods he had left at rome quoth she the fellows taleis nothing but lies i have lived with him all these years and i tell youhe was born at lyons you behold a fellowburgess of marcus footnotereference unknown as i say he was born at the sixteenth milestone fromvienne a native gaul so of course he took rome as a good gaul ought todo i pledge you my word that in lyons he was born where licinusfootnote a gallic slave appointed by augustus procurator of gallialugudunensis when he made himself notorious by his extortions see dioncass liv was king so many years but you that have trudged over moreroads than any muleteer that plies for hire you must have come across thepeople of lyons and you must know that it is a far cry from xanthus to therhone at this point claudius flared up and expressed his wrath with asbig a growl as he could manage what he said nobody understood as a matterof fact he was ordering my lady of fever to be taken away and making thatsign with his trembling hand which was always steady enough for that iffor nothing else by which he used to decapitate men he had ordered herhead to be chopped off for all the notice the others took of him theymight have been his own freedmenthen hercules said you just listen to me and stop playing the fool you have come to the place where the mice nibbleiron footnote a proverb found also in herondas

proceeds in his most tragicvein declare with speed what spot you claim by birth or with this club fall stricken to the earth this club hath ofttimes slaughtered haughty kings why mumble unintelligible things what land what tribe produced that shaking head declare it on my journey when i sped far to the kingdom of the triple king and from the main hesperian did bring the goodly cattle to the argive

had some fear of a blow fromthe fool claudius seeing a mighty man before him saw things lookedserious and understood that here he had not quite the same preeminenceas at rome where no one was his equal the gallic cock was worth most onhis own dunghill so this is what he was thought to say as far as couldbe made out i did hope hercules bravest of all the gods that youwould take my part with the rest and if i should need a voucher i meantto name you who know me so well do but call it to mind how it was i usedto sit in judgment before your temple whole days together during july andaugust you know what miseries i endured there in hearing the lawyersplead day and night if you had fallen amongst these you may thinkyourself very strong but you would have found it worse than the sewers ofaugeas i drained out more filth than you did but since i wantsome pages have fallen out in which hercules must have been persuadedthe gods are now discussing what hercules tells themno wonder you have forced your way into the senate house no bars or bolts can hold against you only do say whatspecies of god you want the fellow to be made an epicurean god he cannotbe for they have no troubles and cause none a stoic then how can he beglobular as varro says without a head or any other projection there isin him something of the stoic god as i can see now he has neither heartnor head upon my

unknown of the place beso good as to keep the rules of the house what will this person think ofus whoever he is so claudius was led out and the first to be asked hisopinion was father janus he had been made consul elect for the afternoonof the next first of julyfootnote perhaps an allusion to the shorteningof the consuls term which was done to give more candidates a chance ofthe honour being as shrewd a man as you could find on a summers day forhe could see as they say before and behind footnote ii iii alluding here to januss double face he made an eloquent haranguebecause his life was passed in the forum but too fast for the notary totake down that is why i give no full report of it for i dont want tochange the words he used he said a great deal of the majesty of the godsand how the honour ought not to be given away to every tom dick or harryonce said he it was a great thing to become a god now you have madeit a farce therefore that you may not think i am speaking against oneperson instead of the general custom i propose that from this day forwardthe godhead be given to none of those who eat the fruits of the earth orwhom mother earth doth nourish after this bill has been read a third timewhosoever is made said or portrayed to be god i vote he be deliveredover to the bogies and at the next public show be flogged with a birchamongst the new gladiators the next to be asked was diespiter son ofvica pota he also being consul elect and a moneylender by this trade hemade a living used to sell rights of citizenship in a small way herculestrips me up to him daintily and tweaks him by the ear so he uttered hisopinion in these words inasmuch as the blessed claudius is akin to theblessed augustus and also to the blessed augusta his grandmother whom heordered to be made a goddess and whereas he far surpasses all mortal menin wisdom and seeing that it is for the public good that there be some oneable to join romulus in devouring boiled turnips i propose that from thisday forth blessed claudius be a god to enjoy that honour with all itsappurtenances in as full a degree as any other before him and that a noteto that effect be added to ovids metamorphoses the meeting was dividedand it looked as though claudius was to win the day for hercules saw hisiron was in the fire trotted here and trotted there saying dont denyme i make a point of the matter ill do as
